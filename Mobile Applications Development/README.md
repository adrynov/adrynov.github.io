# Mobile Applications Development

This project demonstrates my academic qualifications in mobile application development.

My final project at the [University](https://atu.ie) was to create a list of players using Ionic 3 (archived). I am also experienced in developing native Android applications.

## Indicative Knowledge

- GUI Development for Mobile Devices
- Persistent Data Storage
- Widgets and Services
- Location-aware Services and Mapping

## Weather & News app

A very simple Ionic mobile application that [reads news, weather, and country data](./WeatherNews) from
internet resources.

The project requirement was to use Ionic 3 so have that installed (current version of Ionic is 6). 

Run the Ionic app the usual way: `npm run start`

If the message "Type 'ModuleWithProviders' is not generic" appears, reinstall Ionic Storage: 

`npm i @ionic/storage@2.2.0 --save`


## McDonalds clone

I decided to give [React Native](http://reactnative.dev/) a try, so the project will mimic the [MacDonalds' Interface Concept](https://dribbble.com/shots/7049291-McDonald-s-Touch-Interface-Concept).

![Concept](./McDonalds/Design.png "McDonald's")

I am only beginning to master React Native so at the moment the application shows a bare front page.

To-do list:

- Learn UI basics using React Native
- Add screens for product or category details
- Determine the best way to make API calls (axios?)
- Databases in React Native
- Apply advanced React features such as hooks, Redux, etc.

Setup the development environment to build and run React Native applications: http://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

To start the application, execute `yarn expo start`
