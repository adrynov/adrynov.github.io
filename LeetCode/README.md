I use LeetCode regularly to improve my problem-solving skills by trying different challenges,
practicing real interview questions and learning fundamental data structures and algorithms

Yes, it easy to feel overwhelmed but participating in contests, nutcracking difficult exercises and
learning from others really helps.
