This is my portfolio (and a digital repository) containing a series of repositories/sections that document and showcase projects from each module / subject I studied as part of my **Higher Diploma in Computer Science** programme at <a href="https://www.atu.ie/" target="_blank">Atlantic Technological University</a> in 2022:

- [Agile Software Development](Agile%20Software%20Development/README.md)
- [Computer Architecture and Technology Convergence](Computer%20Architecture/README.md)
- [Computational Thinking with Algorithms](Thinking%20with%20Algorithms/README.md)
- [Database Design & Development](Database%20Design%20and%20Development/README.md)
- [Mobile Applications Development](Mobile%20Applications%20Development/README.md)
- [Network Technologies](Network%20Technologies/README.md)

- [Operating Systems and Cloud Computing](Operating%20Systems%20and%20Cloud%20Computing/README.md)

While learning various critical skills, I am also gathering a number of new projects to present in the future.
