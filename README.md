**Why I created this repo?**

I have amassed a good number of projects to show off (not to mention the ones tragically destroyed by my "smarter" future self).
I built them to teach myself various critical skills.

Some of the projects are very simple, some are more advanced, they can be useful and good enough to others -
or on the contrary, no kitten will be saved. It does not matter.

I learnt a lot from reading other people's code, so I want to give back and I hope you might find this repository worth your time.

## Technology

I use GitHub docs feature to host this project.

I loved the [Arsha Bootstrap template](https://bootstrapmade.com/arsha-free-bootstrap-html-template-corporate/) and used
for my content.
