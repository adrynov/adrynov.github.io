This is my portfolio (and a digital repository) containing a series of repositories/sections that document and showcase projects from each module / subject I studied as part of my **Higher Diploma in Computer Science** programme at [Atlantic Technological University](https://www.atu.ie/) in 2022:

- Agile Software Development
- Computer Architecture and Technology Convergence
- Computational Thinking with Algorithms
- Database Design & Development
- Mobile Applications Development
- Object Oriented Software Development (2 semesters)
- Operating Systems and Cloud Computing

While learning various critical skills, I am also gathering a number of new projects to present in the future.
