# Web Application Development

This project demonstrates my academic qualifications in web application development.

The focus of the module was to introduce students to modern web application and network application development using
frameworks in high-level programming and scripting languages. The focus is on building light-weight network services,
particularly web-based services, and integrating those services with modern front-end frameworks

I generated the web project with Angular CLI 15 and deployed it to https://adrynov.github.io/ -
my portfolio's frontpage.

## Indicative Knowledge

- Web technologies: HTML / JavaScript /CSS
- Web applications frameworks: Routing, Static resources, Templates, Error messages, User inputs, Data handling
- Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX)
- JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)

## Requirements

- Angular CLI 15 and above

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you
change any of the source files.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a
package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
