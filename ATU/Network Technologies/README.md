# Network Technologies

This project demonstrates my academic skills in developing network applications with Java.

The application retrieves the weather forecast for the user using IP geolocation services.

First, we obtain the user's IPv4 address by querying public servers.

In an ideal situation, the IP address will pinpoint to the city where the user is located.
The IP lookup is not 100% accurate because the user may be behind a proxy server, their ISP
may not be providing the real address, or is connected via VPN.
However, it is good enough for the demo.

Next we use the IP address to find the location information such as country/city/coordinates using either

- [IPInfo](https://ipinfo.io/)
- [GeoLite2 databases](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data), a free offering by MaxMind.

Here is a sample output:
