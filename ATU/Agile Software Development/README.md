# Agile Software development

This project demonstrates my academic skills in Agile Software Development.

I created a simple application representing a car park and evolved its design using refactoring techniques. 
Next I covered the project with units tests using automated testing frameworks such as JUnit.
Finally, I analysed the quality of source code using industry standard code and coverage metrics.
