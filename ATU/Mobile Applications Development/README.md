# Mobile Applications Development

This project demonstrates my academic qualifications in mobile application development.

My final project at the university was to create a list of players using Ionic 3.  Having developed  mobile applications in Ionic in the past, I chose another approach. 

This project mimics the [MacDonalds' Interface Concept](https://dribbble.com/shots/7049291-McDonald-s-Touch-Interface-Concept) using **React Native**.
