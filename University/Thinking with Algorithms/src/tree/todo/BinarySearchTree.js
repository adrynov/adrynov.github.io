/* Binary Search Tree!!
*
* Nodes that will go on the Binary Tree.
* They consist of the data in them, the node to the left, the node
* to the right, and the parent from which they came from.
*
* A binary tree is a data structure in which an element
* has two successors(children). The left child is usually
* smaller than the parent, and the right child is usually
* bigger.
