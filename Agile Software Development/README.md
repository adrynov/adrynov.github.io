# Agile Software development

This project demonstrates my academic skills in Agile Software Development.

I created a simple application representing a car park and evolved its design using refactoring techniques.
Next I covered the project with units tests using automated testing frameworks such as JUnit.
Finally, I analysed the quality of source code using industry standard code and coverage metrics.

The application keeps asking for car registrations until the parking lot is full (max 10 spaces).
If you re-enter the same car number, it means the car has exited the car park and the spot is available.

## Indicative Knowledge
